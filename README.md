This code was written using Python 3.7.13. 
My OS is Ventura 13.2.1 .

The user should not have to install any packages, but if one somehow finds that they do I would recommend using` pip install`
For example,
`pip install <package name>`

If you are unsure of what python version (if any) you have, here is a handy link to troubleshoot those issues.
